Resource groups
- We were unable to create a RG manually in portal
  - Is this due to naming convention policy?
  - Are users blocked from creating them? Why?
  - Will terraform be able to create them?
  - Should we just use the existing ones?
  ** We will just use core to get on
  - import the existing resource using "terraform import azurerm_resource_group.core RESOURCE ID"

AZ CLI implicitly logged in
- terraform is scoped to subscription / tenant of the signed in az cli user

App Service Plan
- dev sub: works OK (with az cli logged in as RK)
- prod sub: In progress
  - Needs PIM ????
  - Look at using a managed identity
    - Role assignment button disabled in portal
